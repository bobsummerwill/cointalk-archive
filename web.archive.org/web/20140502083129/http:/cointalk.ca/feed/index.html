Ethereum travelled there anticipating many technical questions, as well as a philosophical discussion about the purpose of Ethereum. We were astounded by the overwhelming amount of interest and enthusiasm for our ideas. Vitalik&#039;s presentation was met with both a standing ovation, and a question queue that took over an hour to address.

<p>When the grand experiment that is bitcoin began, the anonymous wizard desired to test two parameters &#8211; a trustless, decentralized database enjoying security enforced by the austere relentlessness of cryptography and a robust transaction system capable of sending value across the world without intermediaries. Yet the past five years years have painfully demonstrated a third missing feature: a sufficiently powerful Turing-complete scripting language. Up until this point, most innovation in advanced applications such as domain and identity registration, user-issued currencies, smart property, smart contracts, and decentralized exchange has been highly fragmented, and implementing any of these technologies has required creating an entire meta-protocol layer or even a specialized blockchain. Theoretically, however, each and every one of these innovations and more can potentially be made hundreds of times easier to implement, and easier to scale, if only there was a stronger foundational layer with a powerful scripting language for all of these protocols to build upon. And this need is what we seek to satisfy.</p>
<p>Ethereum is a modular, Turing-complete contract scripting system married to a blockchain and developed with a philosophy of simplicity, universality and non-discrimination. Our goal is to provide a platform for decentralized applications &#8211; an android of the cryptocurrency world, where all efforts can share a common set of APIs, trust-less interactions and no compromises. We ask for the community to join us as volunteers, developers, investors and evangelists seeking to enable a fundamentally different paradigm for the internet and the relationships it provides.</p>
